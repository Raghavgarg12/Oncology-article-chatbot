# Nature Oncology Crawler

This Python application crawls article data from the "https://www.nature.com/subjects/oncology" section of the Nature website, focusing specifically on oncology-related articles. It then extracts relevant information, performs summarization and keyword extraction, and stores the data in a MySQL database for further processing and retrieval. Finally, it creates vectors for journal titles using an embedding method and stores them in a Milvus vector database for efficient querying.
